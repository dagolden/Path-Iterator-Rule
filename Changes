    [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

    - Test subroutines now get path, basename and stash
      instead of just path and stash; this saves substantial
      overhead on name checks.

    [ADDED]

    - Add 'sorted' option that defaults to true; disabling
      this can improve speed for directories with many files

    [CHANGED]

    - Setting 'error_handler' to undef disables error
      checks for speed

    - Various other optimizations for improved performance
