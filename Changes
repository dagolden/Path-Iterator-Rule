    [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

    - Custom rule logic has changed.  The previous "0 but true" hack

      to signal that a directory should be pruned but returned or
      pruned and skipped, respectively

    [ADDED]

    - Added 'skip_subdirs' method (Issue #7)

    [DOCUMENTED]

    - Clarified max/min depth rules

0.010     2013-01-31 15:56:17 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    [CHANGED]

    - Calling all() in void context will iterate but not store results

    [FIXED]

0.007     2013-01-23 22:35:47 America/New_York

    [CHANGED]

    - Even more internal optimization

    [ADDED]

    - Added 'iter_fast' and 'all_fast' methods that switch default options
      from safe to fast

0.003     2013-01-23 18:32:31 America/New_York

    [DOCUMENTED]

    - Added PERFORMANCE section with tips

    - Additional internal optimization

0.002     2013-01-23 14:38:24 America/New_York

    [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

    - Test subroutines now get path, basename and stash
      instead of just path and stash; this saves substantial
      overhead on name checks.

    [ADDED]

    - Add 'sorted' option that defaults to true; disabling
      this can improve speed for directories with many files

    [CHANGED]

    - Setting 'error_handler' to undef disables error
      checks for speed

    - Various other optimizations for improved performance
